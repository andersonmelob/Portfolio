                <h1> Muay Thai </h1>
                <strong><smal> Since I was a young boy, I wanted to become a fighter, and in 2005 I decided to get it started. So, I started with Muay Thai.  Muay Thai is an art from Thailand that you have to fight the other opponents standing up. I did train intensely for around 8 months until my first may Thai fight. Yes, it was basically too early to have my first fight, but I did, and I did great, I finished the guy in the first round. After that, I kept training and did a few more fights.</p>

                <h1> Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  </h1>
               
                <p>While I was training may Thai, I realised that I wanted to become a MMA fighter, but for that to happen I need to learn other artes as well, such as, Brazilian jiu jitsu, boxing, wrestling. 
                    In 2006, I got enrolled in a jiu jitsu academy. And once again, after a few months of intensely training, I got in my first competition as a white belt. This time, I lost in my first match, but it made get more motivated because I saw that I could make my goal ,of becoming a mma fighter, happen.</p>

                <h1 class="main.articles"> Becoming a Mma Fighter </h1>
                <p> In 2008, three years after I started training in martial arts, I started to think a lot that my first mma fight could happen very soon. I started talking to my teachers about finding competitors for me.
                    Then, at the end of 2008, I made my MMA debut. This experience was more exciting than anything I've ever had in my life up until then. More than any fight I've had, or even any crazy roller coaster ride, lmao.
                    I won my MMA debut with a knockout, and it makes me look back on the hard work and dedication I put into achieving that goal. It made me a stronger believer to this day that I can achieve any other future goals if I put in hard work and dedication.</p>
